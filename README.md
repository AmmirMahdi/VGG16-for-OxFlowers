# VGG16-for-OxFlowers
Based on VGG16, I used tensorflow to implement the image classification model. Due to the small size of the dataset, VGG16 is prone to overfitting. In addition to the use of regular terms, I changed the network to a fully convolutional structure, and reduced convolutional channels to reduce network parameters. Results showed this effectively avoided overfitting.
